				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;"> 
					When I'm not engrossed in my laptop, you'll often find me in the midst of late-night DotA skirmishes, honing my military prowess in Age of Empires, or immersing myself in the enchanting universe of The Witcher. My lifelong love affair with computers and gaming began at the tender age of five, culminating in the exhilarating experience of building my own custom PC during my early teens—an ode to my enduring tech passion.	
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;"> 
					Beyond the digital realm, my interests encompass marathons of TV shows, movies, and anime with captivating characters with whom I resonate, including the freedom-seeking Eren Yaegar, the brave and the bold Batman, morally complex Jamie Lannister, and the hilariously irreverent Michael Scott.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;"> 
					In recent times, my professional endeavours have centred on the captivating domains of explainable machine learning, computer vision, and AI for health. These pursuits underscore my unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology to enhance the well-being of individuals and communities.

						Kon'nichiwa!!

						I'm currently on the exciting path of pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego.
						
						My adventure in computer science began with a memorable two-year stint at the Solarillion Foundation in Chennai, where I first dipped my toes into the fascinating world of Machine Learning Research. Let me tell you, that experience ignited a real passion in me.
						
						Now, UCSD is the real deal—it's got top-notch professors, cutting-edge research facilities, a seriously competitive peer group, and a network of accomplished alumni that's pretty darn impressive.
						
						And here's the scoop: I'm all set to don the cap and gown and graduate from UCSD in June 2024. So, stick around because there's a lot more to come in this journey, and I'm stoked for my upcoming years.

						My journey at the Solarillion Foundation began in December 2019, when I started as a research assistant. During this time, I led a research team of five where we worked on fake news detection, which resulted in publications at a renowned international conference in Australia (AusDM). Additionally, I contributed to the field of malware analysis, where I held the role of second author, and our work earned recognition at a conference in Poland (ICCS).
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;">
						In March 2020, I took on the role of teaching assistant, where I had the privilege of mentoring over 15 students during their orientation phase. I taught Python and machine learning, guiding students through data wrangling, modelling, and result analysis—laying the foundation for solving complex machine learning problems.
						As a dedicated member of the project review committee, I reviewed and provided valuable insights for over 20 students' project reports. My involvement didn't stop there; I played a crucial role in the Server Team, where I developed modules and maintained the compute server at the Solarillion Foundation.

						My academic journey has seamlessly converged with my graduate school experience, fostering collaborations with esteemed research labs. During the Winter 2023 quarter, I worked at the Nemati lab, where I confronted a pivotal challenge in medical data analysis. Due to the inherent variability of data collection practices across healthcare institutions, the data available for modelling is very sparse. Such data results in a large number of uncertain predictions where the data points are clustered around the decision boundary. These potentially ambiguous predictions can significantly hinder the reliability of the predictive models. To address this, I implemented variational auto-encoders to derive a latent representation space, generating augmented data that, when integrated with the original training data, substantially enhanced the performance of a sepsis predictor.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;">
						Fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the intricacies of the human brain, I joined Prof. Shtrahman's lab in the Department of Neuroscience. My current focus revolves around exploring hyperexcitability and synchrony in neuronal activity within an epilepsy mouse model, utilizing calcium imaging data from the dentate gyrus and CA1 region. My responsibilities include establishing a robust data pipeline, automating simulations with MATLAB scripts, and conducting statistical analyses. These analyses aim to uncover distinctive neuron firing patterns associated with normal and epileptic brain activities, considering both sparse and dense neural code data. Also, I employ various statistical tests to identify correlations in neuron firing behavior.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1px;">
						Beyond my research pursuits, I had the privilege of serving as the Teaching Assistant for CSE 21: Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems Analysis. In this role, I managed a class of 35+ students, formulated examination question papers, organised weekly discussion sessions, and held office hours. I am excited to continue in this role for the Fall 2023 quarter, with an expected class size of 200+ students.

									Detecting Brain Abnormalities using Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning</p></a>
								<em>Deep Learning Research (Self-Supervised Learning - Medical Domain)</em>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									In my undergraduate thesis project, I led a team to develop a self-supervised contrastive learning-based solution for the detection and classification of brain abnormalities, with a primary focus on identifying various types of haemorrhages within the brain.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">

									Generating scene graphs using Transformers with Knowledge infusion and Residual Connections</p></a>
								<em>Deep Learning Research (Scene-Graphs)</em>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Scene graph generation is a dynamic field of research that revolves around representing visual scenes using nodes and edges. When presented with an image, the primary objective is to identify the entities or objects within the image and establish relationships between them. In this context, the nodes in a scene graph represent potential objects, while the edges signify the connections or relationships between these nodes. For example, when analysing an image containing both a car and a person, the model must discern if there is an action or relationship connecting the car and the person.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									This project builds upon prior research conducted in the realm of Relation Transformers (RelTR). Our innovative approach involves introducing residual connections between modules and infusing pre-existing knowledge about objects into the system. The underlying hypothesis is that these enhancements will empower the model to identify objects and their relationships with greater speed and accuracy.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									To evaluate our customised architecture's performance, we conducted a comprehensive comparison against the baseline RelTR model. Our assessments were carried out on the visual genome dataset, utilising both 5,000 and 7,500 training samples. The results of this comparative analysis provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed model, shedding light on its potential benefits and limitations.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									This project represents an important step forward in the pursuit of more efficient and accurate scene graph generation, with practical implications in various fields, including computer vision and image analysis.

								<em>Model Interpretability and Explainability</em>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									In this project, our objective was to explore a range of interpretability approaches applicable to deep learning models employed for medical classification tasks. We recognised the potential significance of such endeavours in bolstering AI for the healthcare industry and instilling trust in the deployment of these models in high-stakes domains.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Our primary focus was on the post-hoc analysis of these models, and we extend our gratitude to the survey paper titled "Post-hoc Interpretability for Neural NLP: A Survey" for providing valuable insights into this complex problem domain.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Interpretability approaches can be broadly categorised into two main branches: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic methods involve the generation of explanations by the model's own architecture, while extrinsic or post-hoc methods analyse the model's outputs to generate explanations. Our work exclusively delved into post-hoc approaches within the context of medical natural language processing (NLP). These approaches are often preferred due to their model-agnostic nature, treating the underlying model as a black box and relying on its outputs to generate explanations. It's worth noting that post-hoc methods, while practical, can sometimes be critiqued for potentially offering misleading explanations for models that are inherently complex and difficult to explain.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Throughout this study, we leveraged a fine-tuned pre-trained BERT-based model and implemented a diverse array of post-hoc methods. Our aim was to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, shedding light on their applicability and reliability within the context of medical NLP. This project served as our submission for the final assessment in the course CSE 256: Statistical NLP at the University of California, San Diego.

								<em>Deep Learning Research (Self-Supervised Learning - Medical Domain)</em>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Image restoration encompasses a category of problems focused on rectifying abnormalities and enhancing the quality of images. Among these challenges, image denoising and colorization are particularly noteworthy. The literature on this subject reveals an abundance of research, employing both Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Deep Learning algorithms tailored for these tasks typically adopt an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoding phase reduces the input image to a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder phase amplifies this representation to reconstruct the output image. Therefore, the quality and robustness of the latent representations are crucial, as they must contain sufficient information to faithfully reconstruct the output.
								</p><br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									In this project, we introduce innovative Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning approaches to acquire robust representations of the dataset. These representations serve as the foundation for training a decoder module responsible for executing image restoration tasks, such as denoising and colorization. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation, comparing and contrasting the effectiveness of our two-stage training module with traditional end-to-end training methods like  ResNet50, EfficientNet, and InceptionNet, as backbone networks. This work was part of the CSE 251B - Neural Networks & Pattern Recognition course's final project.
